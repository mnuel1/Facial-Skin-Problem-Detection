# Setting up Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, Pandas, and NumPy

Follow these steps to set up a development environment with Python and the required libraries for your machine learning or computer vision project.

## Step 1: Install Python

1. Download the latest Python installer for your operating system from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Run the installer and follow the installation prompts.

3. Verify Python installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and running:

   ```bash
   python --version
   
## Step 2: Install OpenCV, Pandas and Numpy

1. Install the OpenCV, Panda and Numpy library for computer vision tasks and data manipulation and handling using **pip**:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install pandas numpy

## Step 3: Install Tensorflow, Tensorflow lite and Tensorflow lite Runtime

1. Install the needed dependencies using **pip**:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install tflite
   pip install tflite-runtime

## Running the virtual environment
> go to cd C:\path\to\your\project\directory\myenv and open it in terminal
1. to activate the virtual environment 
   
   ```bash
   .\Scripts\Activate.ps1

2. to deactivate

   ```bash
   deactivate
